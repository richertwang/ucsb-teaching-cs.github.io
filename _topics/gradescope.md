# Thoughts on Gradescope Rubrics (by P. Conrad)

The following are some personal opinions about Gradescope Rubrics.   They may be different from what your supervising instructor has in mind, so be sure to check with them before applying these.


1. I try to be consistent that the first rubric item (or items in case of multiple alternative correct answers) 
   is a perfect/correct answer... and I try to always TYPE OUT an example of a perfect correct answer.   
   
   This is so that students that get the question wrong will know what the answer "should have been" for when they study.    I do this rather than publishing an answer key, because it keeps the answer key behind a login portal, and makes it harder to just download and publish.

2. For deductions, I try to be as specific as possible, and offer specific explanations, 
   rather than vague explanation such as (-5) a wee bit wrong  (-10)  half right/half wrong (-20) totally wrong.  Where possible, an explanation of what the student should have done instead is helpful.

   The point is that the rubrics are NOT just documentation of the grade... they are an opportunity to teach.  They may be one of the MOST IMPORTANT opportunities to teach, because many students really *care* about their grades.     They sometimes, sadly, may care more about the grade than the actual learning.   So it's an important opportunity to take advantage of that "teachable moment".  Conversely, if we don't take advantage, we are missing what may be out best chance to help the student learn.

3. I use positive rather than negative scoring (i.e. default grade is 0, and you work "up from zero" 
   rather than  "down from perfect").  That's a personal preference; I don't have a strong rationale for why. 

   My sense, though, intuitively (from a "user experience" perspective) is that it's probably best to choose one direction (either positive or negative scoring) for the **entire course** and then stick with it.  If deviations from the course standard are made, there should be a good rationale, and it should be pointed out to everyone (all graders and all students) to avoid confusion.
